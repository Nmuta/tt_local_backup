## App setup
### Git Submodules
To ensure proper suppression of CA/SA warnings, you want to be sure to download the data-buildmodule Submodule.
Use this command when creating your repository to pull down all submodules.
```console
git clone --recurse-submodules https://dev.azure.com/turn10/Services/_git/Data-BuildModule
```

### Zendesk
Follow the instructions listed in the [LiveOps OneNote Setup Page](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Turn10LiveOpsTools/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={768af33f-6711-4663-815b-7c0007bfa8bf}&action=edit&wd=target%28ZAF.one%7Ce6ecf726-05a8-4a4f-8947-6b605f34e456%2FZendesk%20First%20Time%20setup%7C2f92f1a6-1364-46b7-af36-d29c8a5dgit89dc%2F%29).


### UI
Steward's UI is built with Node, Yarn, and Angular.
In order to get started, you need to make sure [Node and Yarn](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your machine.
> Make sure node version >= 16.x 
To install yarn use the following command
```console
npm install --global yarn
```

<br>
Before building the project, you need to run the yarn package script refreshVSToken and for the script to work you need to add the vsts-npm-auth package.
In the StewardClient directory, run the following commands
```console
npm install -g vsts-npm-auth
yarn run refreshVSToken
```

Next, you need to install the projects node package dependencies.
In the StewardClient directory, run the yarn command

```console
yarn 
```

<br />
To access the app's tools, you will need to be given permission to the Steward Azure AAD Apps 
 
( 
[Dev AAD App](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/~/Overview/appId/cfe0ac3f-d0a7-4566-99f7-0c56b7a9f7d4/isMSAApp) 
& 
[Prod AAD App](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationMenuBlade/~/Overview/appId/796faca8-01de-436e-b75e-fb981756d5ed/isMSAApp/) 
)
<br />
Please reach out to anyone on the LiveOps dev team to give you permissions.

### API
Steward's API is built with .NET Core 6.0.

To run the API project in visual studio 2019, you need .NET Core 6.0.203 installed and NOT 6.0.300 or latest. (When downgrading a folder called 6.0.300 might still be in C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk which is what dotnet
will use when trying to use the latest version. The folder will be empty and deleting it will make dotnet use 6.0.203 (a way to check that is by simply opening a command prompt and typing "dotnet --version")

You will need to install Visual Studio to run the app.

To run the app locally, you will also need to have GET Secrets permissions to 
[Steward's Dev KeyVault](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/c4dda634-84ec-483e-9ee5-c4c43511f8f3/resourceGroups/steward-dev/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/steward-keyvault-dev/overview) <br />
Please reach out to anyone on the LiveOps dev team to give you permissions.

## Running the app
### Zendesk
You have two options to run Zendesk locally:

1) Run bash.exe and change working directory to Web-Steward/StewardClient/app-local. Once inside, run `zat serve`.

2) Run the npm command `npm run dev:zat`. This does everything in option 1 automatically for you

### UI
There are two different types of local environments that can be used.

1) All local - `yarn start:local-api` - this will run the Angular app locally and point all API requests to a local instance of Steward API.

2) Local UI/ Dev API - `yarn start`- this will run the Angular app locally and point all API requests to the DEV instance of Steward API.
  
### API
To run the Steward API locally, open up the solution in Visual Studio. Make sure the StewardApi project is set as the Startup Project and click the Visual Studio's run button (green arrow).

This should open up the API's local swagger page on: https://localhost:44321/swagger/index.html

## Testing the app
### UI
You have multiple options to run client unit tests.

1) `npm run local:test:chrome` - Run using Chrome
2) `npm run local:test:ff` - Run using Firefox
3) `npm run vsts:test` - Run using headless browser
3) `npm run vsts:test:ncc` - Run using headless browser without code coverage results:

### API
API testing is simple and can all be done through Visual Studio's **Test Explorer**

### Background Jobs and Race Conditions
Specifically in V2 type controllers, be aware that running background jobs must maintain a local variable of any proxied services
that the background job relies on to complete. Never call 'this.Services...' inside of a background job, always declare a local 
var outside the background Task 'var liveOpsService = this.Services.LiveOpsService' and then use 'liveOpsService' to make
any relevant requests.
