          Internal impact refers to the ability of an employee to perform their job. <br />
          For example, a new tool that can drastically reduce the time it takes for the support team
          to perform a specific task has a High impact, as it significantly affects their
          productivity. A Low impact would be a suggestion for a minor UX adjustment, as it has
          little effect on their ability to use the tool effectively.

        </mat-button-toggle-group>
        <help-popover-icon>
          External impact refers to a player's ability to play the game or do something within the
          game as a service. <br />
          For example, adjusting a tool that allows players to recover lost inventory data more
          quickly would have a High impact, as it can significantly impact gameplay and overall
          enjoyment of the game. A Low impact would be an alteration to the Messaging tool, which
          does not affect gameplay or user experience.

          Internal impact refers to the ability of an employee to perform their job. <br />
          For example, a bug that breaks an API and prevents someone from using a tool has a High
          impact, as it significantly affects productivity. A Low impact would be a minor cosmetic
          error that is causing text to display improperly, as it is inconvenient but has little
          effect on someone's ability to use the tool effectively.

        <help-popover-icon>
          External impact refers to a player's ability to play or do something within the game as a
          service. <br />
          For example, a bug that hides all of a player's UGC when another flag gets adjusted has a
          High impact, as it can significantly impact gameplay and overall enjoyment of the game. A
          Low impact would be a minor bug that won't allow players to be gifted a minor item, which
          does not significantly affect gameplay or user experience.

          A workaround is a temporary or alternative solution to a bug that can help get the job
          done while the team investigates the issue. Knowing if workarounds exist can help
          determine the severity and impact of a bug.
