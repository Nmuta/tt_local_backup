// TODO: Feels like we probably don't need this service.
//
// It is not really doing anything except
// - Setting content type on a couple request formats, which we can do in interceptors
// - Currying in a custom URL base (which we can do with a function like toSteward(path) that uses environment settings)
// - proxying the API in a marginally different way
//
// WRT to the proxying the API,
// - doesn't seem to save much (if anything?) in the common scenarios
// - in uncommon scenarios, causes you to have to choose between
//   - modify the ApiService to support the new scenario; which requires design work and I think breaks an OOP principal?
//   - use HttpClient directly, which means there are now 2+ ways in which we might make a request
// - I think most features you could implement this way would probably be nicer as interceptors?
//
// Perhaps it has some utility for test hooks?
// Though I believe Angular has an entire suite of tools specifically around that
// (not that I've usually bothered to test such things, they seem like generally "last pass" sort of tests. Useful, but not as useful as other things).
// If we do keep it for that reason, it should probably be made to more directly resemble the upstream APIs and just modify the passed thru values a bit.
